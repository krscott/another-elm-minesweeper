Yet another Elm implementation of Minesweeper

[Live Demo](https://krscott.github.io/another-elm-minesweeper/)

![gameboard example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krscott/another-elm-minesweeper/master/gameboard.png)

## Intro
I created this project as an exercise to learn Elm.

## Build
The script `build.sh` compiles the source using `elm make`, then copies over
the html and css files.

## Live Dev Environment
Elm-live will refresh the browser window refresh whenever an .elm file is
updated in `src`.

Install elm-live if it is not already installed:
```bash
npm install --global elm-live
```

Then, run the script `live.sh` to start elm-live.
